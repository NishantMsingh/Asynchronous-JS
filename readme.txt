HI This is really very interesting part of javaScript where you will learn about many things like 

How works call backs 
Why we use promises instead of call backs 
And how we can hold a call back function for the sometime while runnig another function and

How we can run all the functions parrellely 

So do not wait for more just go deep dive into in and learn and try to understand all the  features of the Promises and Async await and other stuffs

Thank you
